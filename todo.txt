! prevent duplicate lobbies from being created (that was kinda the point).
- should they have different warmup / bestof: if they are the only lobby, change it.
  otherwise, make a new one with different values and map that in the join table (ef will do that).

state enums for more specific returns instead of bools.
possibly factor out some logic (debating if that would be better).
don't use ok for everything.
